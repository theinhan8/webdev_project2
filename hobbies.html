      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p>There is nothing more relaxing than putting down your technologies and exploring nature. I'm a huge fan of being outdoors because it takes me away from the internet and gives me a chance to socialize with the people around me.</p>

      <h2>Motorcycle</h2>
      <p>Many people would say that motorcycles are too dangerous which I completely agree with, but I still think getting my motorcycle's license is one of the best choices I've made.</p>
